# ðŸ“š C Programming Problem Sets from College

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to 10 complete lists of programming problems in C that I did back then in 2022, when I started my college jorney. These challenges cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, making them a valuable resource for anyone learning C programming or looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“ƒ Problem Sets

1. [Basic Concepts and input/output](/List%201/)
2. [Conditional Statements](/List%202/)
3. [Loops](/List%203/)
4. [Loops and random numbers](/List%203-Extra/)
5. [Functions and Recursion](/List%204/)
6. [Arrays](/List%205/)
7. [Matrices](/list%206/)
8. [Strings](/list%207/)
9. [Pointers](/list%208/)
10. [Structures](/list%209/)

## ðŸš§ Project Status

All 10 problem sets are completed and tested. Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and use them to enhance your understanding of C programming.

## ðŸ“– Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for the challenges I tackled during my college studies. It's designed to assist students and beginners in their programming journey and provide a comprehensive set of solutions to common coding problems.
